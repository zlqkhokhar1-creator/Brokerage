# Marketing Site

This directory hosts the existing marketing website EXACTLY as it was before monorepo migration. If build scripts referenced root paths, update them to relative paths here.

## Original Location

## Build & Development
The original build and development scripts have been preserved. Use the existing package.json scripts:

```
