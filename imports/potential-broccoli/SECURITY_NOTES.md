# üîê Security Notes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Guidelines

### Environment Variables & Secrets

**üö® NEVER COMMIT REAL SECRETS TO VERSION CONTROL**

- Use `.env.local` for local development secrets (git-ignored by default)
- Use `.env.example` as a template - it contains safe placeholder values only
- Use environment-specific files (`.env.production`, `.env.staging`) for deployments
- Consider using a secret manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for production

### JWT Security Best Practices

#### Algorithm Selection
- **Production**: Use RS256 with proper RSA key management
- **Development**: HS256 is acceptable for local development only
- **Never**: Use none algorithm or allow algorithm switching

#### Key Management
- **RS256 Keys**: Generate 2048-bit or 4096-bit RSA keys
- **HS256 Secrets**: Minimum 32 characters, use cryptographically secure random generation
- **Rotation**: Implement regular key/secret rotation (recommended: every 90 days)
- **Storage**: Store private keys securely, never in application code

#### Token Lifecycle
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived (15 minutes recommended)
- **Refresh Tokens**: Longer-lived (7 days) with proper rotation
- **Revocation**: Implement token blacklisting for immediate revocation
- **Logging**: Log authentication events, never log token values

### Configuration Security

#### Environment Validation
- All security-related environment variables are validated at startup
- Application fails fast with clear error messages for missing configuration
- Configuration summary is logged (sensitive values excluded)

#### Fail-Fast Principle
```bash
# Example: Application startup with missing JWT configuration
‚ùå Configuration validation failed:
JWT_ISSUER: Required
JWT_AUDIENCE: Required

Process exits with code 1 - no partial startup allowed
```

### Development vs Production

#### Development Setup
```bash
# Safe for local development
JWT_ALG=HS256
JWT_SECRET=dev-secret-at-least-32-characters-long
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=dev-refresh-secret-at-least-32-characters-long
```

#### Production Requirements
```bash
# Production configuration
JWT_ALG=RS256
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/secure/path/to/private.pem
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH=/secure/path/to/public.pem

# OR via environment variables (escaped newlines)
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
JWT_PUBLIC_KEY="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\n...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
```

### Logging Security

#### Sensitive Data Redaction
The logging system automatically redacts sensitive information:

- Authorization headers ‚Üí `Bearer [REDACTED]`
- JWT tokens ‚Üí `[REDACTED-{length}]`
- Passwords, secrets, keys ‚Üí `[REDACTED]`

#### Security Event Logging
- All authentication attempts (success/failure) are logged
- Failed authentication attempts include contextual information for monitoring
- Successful authentication includes user context (non-sensitive)

### Network Security

#### HTTPS Requirements
- **Production**: Always use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
- **Development**: HTTP acceptable for localhost only
- **Headers**: Implement security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

#### CORS Configuration
- Configure CORS origins restrictively
- Never use wildcard (*) origins in production
- Validate and whitelist allowed origins

### Monitoring & Alerting

#### Security Metrics to Monitor
- Failed authentication attempts per IP/user
- Token expiration patterns
- Configuration validation failures
- Unexpected algorithm usage

#### Recommended Alerts
- High volume of authentication failures
- Tokens with unexpected issuers/audiences
- Configuration validation failures on startup
- Suspicious IP access patterns

### Compliance Considerations

#### Audit Requirements
- All authentication events are logged with timestamps
- User actions are traceable via session IDs
- Configuration changes are logged
- Token lifecycle events are recorded

#### Data Protection
- No sensitive user data in JWT payload beyond necessary claims
- Tokens have appropriate expiration times
- User consent for data processing is tracked
- Right to be forgotten implementation ready

### Future Security Enhancements

#### Roadmap (Implementation Priority)
1. **Key Rotation**: Automated key rotation with zero downtime
2. **MFA Support**: Multi-factor authentication integration
3. **Rate Limiting**: Advanced rate limiting and DDoS protection
4. **RBAC Engine**: Fine-grained role and permission management
5. **Audit Dashboard**: Real-time security monitoring and alerting
6. **Compliance**: SOC2, PCI DSS, ISO 27001 compliance frameworks

#### Integration Planning
- **Secret Managers**: AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault
- **Identity Providers**: OIDC, SAML, Active Directory
- **Monitoring**: Datadog, New Relic, custom monitoring solutions
- **SIEM Integration**: Security Information and Event Management

## üõ°Ô∏è Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response

#### Token Compromise
1. Immediately rotate JWT signing keys/secrets
2. Invalidate all active tokens (force re-authentication)
3. Review logs for suspicious activity patterns
4. Notify affected users if necessary

#### Configuration Exposure
1. Rotate all exposed secrets immediately
2. Audit git history for committed secrets
3. Review access logs for unauthorized usage
4. Update security documentation

#### System Compromise
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve logs for forensic analysis
3. Rotate all authentication credentials
4. Conduct thorough security audit
