# Phase 5 Review Guide

This guide provides a structured approach for reviewing the Phase 5 implementation of Identity + Payments + Ledger Persistence.

## Review Order

### 1. Database Migrations (Start Here)
Review migrations in order to understand schema evolution:

- `apps/backend/db/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql` - Base schema
- `apps/backend/db/migrations/0007_users_indexes.sql` - User enhancements 
- `apps/backend/db/migrations/0008_payments_enhance.sql` - Payment system
- `apps/backend/db/migrations/0009_ledger_core.sql` - Ledger implementation

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Migrations are additive-only (no destructive changes)
- ✅ Proper indexing for performance
- ✅ CHECK constraints for data integrity
- ✅ Foreign key relationships are correct
- ✅ Enum types are properly defined

### 2. TypeScript Type Definitions
Review the database schema types:

- `apps/backend/src/types/database.ts` - Complete type definitions

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Types match database schema exactly
- ✅ Nullable fields properly marked as optional
- ✅ BIGINT fields typed as string (JavaScript limitation)
- ✅ Enum types match database enums

### 3. Configuration & Infrastructure
Review configuration and setup:

- `apps/backend/src/config/kysely.ts` - Database ORM setup
- `apps/backend/src/config/featureFlags.js` - Feature flag system
- `apps/backend/src/config/redisClient.js` - Redis client factory
- `apps/backend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Database connection reuses existing pool config
- ✅ Feature flags have sensible defaults
- ✅ Redis client has proper error handling
- ✅ TypeScript config excludes JS files to avoid conflicts

### 4. Repository Layer (Core Implementation)
Review repositories in dependency order:

#### IdempotencyRepository
- `apps/backend/src/repositories/IdempotencyRepository.ts`

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Uses Redis SETNX for atomic key reservation
- ✅ Falls back to database when Redis unavailable  
- ✅ Stores permanent responses in database
- ✅ Proper TTL management

#### UserRepository  
- `apps/backend/src/repositories/UserRepository.ts`

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Argon2id password hashing with proper parameters
- ✅ Automatic password migration on login
- ✅ Refresh token management with rotation
- ✅ Proper error handling for edge cases

#### PaymentRepository
- `apps/backend/src/repositories/PaymentRepository.ts`

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Status transitions use transactions
- ✅ Event auditing for all changes
- ✅ Currency validation and normalization
- ✅ Proper error handling

#### LedgerRepository  
- `apps/backend/src/repositories/LedgerRepository.ts`

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Atomic balance updates with UPSERT
- ✅ Transaction recording with proper direction
- ✅ Balance consistency verification methods
- ✅ Performance optimized queries

### 5. Service Layer (Business Logic)
Review services that integrate repositories:

#### AuthService
- `apps/backend/src/services/AuthService.js`

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Dual-write implementation for safe migration
- ✅ Feature flag integration
- ✅ Proper token generation and validation
- ✅ Error handling for missing repositories

#### PaymentService
- `apps/backend/src/services/PaymentService.js`

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Idempotency integration
- ✅ Ledger integration for status changes
- ✅ Dual-write support
- ✅ Error recovery and logging

#### DriftVerifier
- `apps/backend/src/services/DriftVerifier.js`

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Count comparison between systems
- ✅ Hash-based data verification
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ JSON output support

### 6. Scripts & Tools
Review operational scripts:

- `apps/backend/scripts/migrate.js` - Migration runner
- `apps/backend/scripts/ledger_replay_verify.ts` - Balance verification
- `apps/backend/scripts/cleanup_idempotency.ts` - Key cleanup

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Scripts have proper CLI interfaces
- ✅ Dry-run modes for safety
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ JSON output for automation

### 7. Integration Tests
Review test coverage:

- `tests/integration/test_helpers.js` - Test utilities
- `tests/integration/user_lifecycle.test.js` - User flow tests
- `tests/integration/payment_idempotency.test.js` - Payment tests

**Key Review Points:**
- ✅ Tests skip gracefully when dependencies unavailable
- ✅ Comprehensive test scenarios
- ✅ Proper cleanup and teardown
- ✅ Clear pass/fail reporting
